# Unified Commerce
## What is Unified Commerce? 

Unified Commerce, ***the integration of a retailer's backend systems and sales channels for a truly consistent and friction free customer experience***, is top end approach to fully enabling retailer and customer success. 

A trusting customer is a repeat customer.

Employing an advanced Unified Commerce platform future proofs retailers and so maximizes the potential for returning customers as it taps into the long-term human need to trust and stay on brand. 

> The natural world is filled with brands that send messages across our suite of senses, which we instinctively understand and connect to. This is what we are used to and have come to expect, through the mechanisms of evolution. Ultimately, staying on brand is an inherent survival mechanism, as a break from brand in the natural world disrupts experience and sends a message of danger. We fear an off-brand experience in nature and consequently move away to find a more consistent and safer location. 

> The commercial experience is no different from our inherent need to survive. 

> Whenever we approach a retailer, everything our senses inform us about their brand should be in place as expected, regardless of the location or platform used to engaged with. A company's break from brand, which includes a break in quality of service, means the commercial signals sent by the company disrupts the customer experience and hints at danger, consequently, people move away. 

The need of a retailer or brand to use as many commercial channels as possible (omichanneling), whilst maintaining control of backend operations and business unit systems, has
become essential for survival in today's commercial landscape. E-commerce and business management systems are constantly evolving, and the customer expectation matches that evolution, making it increasingly difficult to stay on brand. 

Unified Commerce allows retailers to provide a customer experience that is consistent across all channels at every location a customer engages with a retailer. The in-store experience matches an online experience. Perhaps most importantly the experience is fault free and frictionless, from the point of entry through to the point of sale. To ensure this, all retail channels and systems are integrated into one platform so that the backend operations of a retailer through to the point of sale can be managed at one unified location. 

Example retail departments that benefit from a Unified commercial experience through Unified Commerce supported integrated platforms:
* Marketing
* Sales
* Customer success
* Finance
* Product
* Communications and digital media
* Support
* New Business

To ensure customer trust, retailers need to unify commerce to provide a truly consistent omnichannel experience.

## Challenges of Unified Commerce 

* **Change management**:Upgrading to a unified modularized structure is a deeply disruptive process for any company. This process often sees the integration of many systems that struggle to integrate and training of employees that can be resistant. Mature companies with complex structures and processes that host many operational and commercial platforms can be challenging to integrate, especially when there is a need to maintain good customer relationships during the change. Employing good change management practices, for example; keeping employees informed, providing good training and reiterating the ultimate benefits of Unified Commerce, are a good way to mitigate stress and complexity.

* **Data Management**: Despite better universal data standardization and curation techniques as well as cheaper and adaptable analytics and management suites, there are still massive amounts of legacy data that have yet to be placed into modern environments and used in advanced applications. It takes time, patience and courage for a company to take the leap and modernize their data practices. No two companies are the same, and so the nuances of a given company will pose unique technical challenges for any IT manager, data engineer or data scientist working through the data. There is also the need to make sure practices are compliant with regulation, which is an aspect of data management increasing in complexity. Companies have policies, countries have regulations as well as continents, making it increasingly difficult to ensure compliance in a landscape that sees data move all around the world. Ensuring data privacy and security in an ever changing political and commercial environment is a major task, requiring expertise and decent technology.

* **Costs**: As with change management, the burden of costs taken on by a company must be related to the future benefits for the company. To stay competitive, the flow of information and the success of a customer must be paramount. Integrating systems into a unified commerce environment provides this possibility. Unified Commerce future proofs a company, which, providing good management practice, supports the longevity of a company.

## Benefits of Unified Commerce

* **Customer experience**: A fully unified system enables a high quality and consistent customer experience. Customers will continue to trust their experience using the channel of their choice, which greatly increases the likelihood of retention. This includes a company's ability to answer any customer question in a quick and satisfactory way, due to easy access to all relevant business units.

* **Operations**: By integrating all business, operational and customer channels into one system, complexity is greatly reduced, and efficiency is significantly increased. This helps ensure consistent messaging and brand alignment throughout the business and sales channels. An entire supply chain can be overseen from one location; from raw material sourcing to inventory, all the way through to reverse logistics.

* **Data management**: A fully Integrated database that can host a multitude of data types from many departments, provides, amongst others, efficient understanding of product availability for purposes of forecasting and logistics, customer behavior and enables the identification of commercial markers and relationships not necessarily intuitive or obvious. In addition, the ability to conduct root cause analysis and predict future issues helps critical thinking and supports more informed and effective decision making.

* **Flexibility**: Observing Moore's laws concerning technological advancements means that there is an expectation of new or constantly improved technology being
made available, at any time. This warrants high levels of adaptability in business and commercial systems, affording the integration of any new technology or data type, regardless of scope or function. This way of working maintains commercial relevance and a competitive edge in any given market. Unified Commerce modularized structure enables this level of flexibility and supports companies through current and future technological turbulence.
